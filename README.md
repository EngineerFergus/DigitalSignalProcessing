# DigitalSignalProcessing
Implementation of many common Digital Signal Processing algorithms. The focus will be on 1D signals with the potential for adding 2D data (such as images) later on. The accompanying WPF Showcase application will be used for visualizing the performance of the algorithms. The [Live Charts Net](https://lvcharts.net/) toolbox will be used for plotting data.
